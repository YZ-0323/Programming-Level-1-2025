/*
Welcome to the Constants and Variables Lab!

In this lab, weâ€™ll explore how to use constants and variables in Swift.

- Constants (created with `let`) are values that donâ€™t change.
- Variables (created with `var`) are values that can change.

Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸš€

// Exercise 1: Declaring a constant
let birthYear=2009

// Exercise 2: Declaring a variable
var currentAge=15
print("My birthyear is \(birthYear),\nand my age is \(currentAge)")
// Exercise 3: Changing the value of a variable
// Imagine youâ€™re a year older. Update `currentAge` to reflect this new age.
currentAge+=1
print("My age is \(currentAge)")

// Exercise 4: Trying to change a constant
// Uncomment the line below to see what happens when you try to change a constant!
// birthYear += 1
// Q: Why doesnâ€™t this work?
//B/c birthyear is a constant
/*
Mini Build: Life Tracker (5 min)

Letâ€™s build a small script that simulates tracking your age over the next few years.
1. Declare a constant for `myBirthYear`.
2. Declare a variable `currentYear` (set it to the current year).
3. Calculate your age by subtracting `myBirthYear` from `currentYear`.
4. Update `currentYear` to simulate each new year, and update your age.

Try adding print statements to track the changes.

let myBirthYear=2009
var currentYear=2025
print("My age this year will be \(currentYear-myBirthYear)")


// Increment the year and age to simulate time passing
