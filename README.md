Programming Level 1

Author: Yizhen Zhu

Contents

This repository contains code that I created during Programming Level 1 in Grade 10.

Most of the code is in Swift and the main framework that we used in the class is SwiftUI.

This also contains the app that I developed. You can find it in the Final Showcase folder.

My slide deck is on Canva, which I pitched during the Final Showcase in June 2025.

Context

During the semester, I learned how to communicate in Swift. I didn't know very much about Swift at first. Throughout the term, I learned how to put together a really cool wireframe in Keynote. Then, I took a chance and learned how to translate those ideas from Keynote into an actual app using Swift.

Note

Developing an app is really fun and I hope to do it again(not the exact same thing of course). Good job to me and everyone who supported me through this semester.
